This project does provide an example of how one can link their Timeular-Zei directly to the TogglAPI, without using the Timeular premium tier service.


Contains a modified version of [TogglPy](https://github.com/matthewdowney/TogglPy)  (TogglPy wasn't able to delete TimeEntries or to create running entries)
